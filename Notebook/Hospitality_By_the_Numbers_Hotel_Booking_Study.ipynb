Through EDA, we identified several key factors influencing bookings and cancellations, such as lead time, deposit type, and booking channels. By addressing these areas, the hotel can potentially reduce cancellations, maximize occupancy, and improve overall guest satisfaction. Implementing data-driven strategies based on the insights from this analysis can lead to more efficient operations and increased profitability for the hotel."
